### What are the pros and cons of TDD?

Pros: 
- Forces your code to be modular as you are needing to write unit test for separate functionality
- Easier to maintain and refactor in the future and allows future developers working on your code to be familiar with the base and edge cases possibly
- TDD forcing the developer to write these unit tests before the implementation helps with code verification and sanity checks. Allowing you to find design
  and requirement issues pretty quickly. 
  
Cons:
- Slows down implementation time as more time is needed for the TDD process, not as conducive in a start-up situation where a MVP is required for funding
- All members of the team must be on the same page for the time and effort being put into TDD, harder to implement a successful TDD process for various levels
of developers working together
- TDD requires constant revisions and tweaks as features are constantly changing in large projects. Maintainability can be very difficult resulting in a degrading
test suite.
